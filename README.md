A list of SQL files with queries from my exploratory analysis of different datasets

## Exploratory Analysis on Cricket Data (Dec 2023)

I am not an avid cricket fan, but I am a Caribbean native and cricket has been ever present throughout my life. As a West Indies supporter, my interest in the sport has sharply declined much like West Indies’ success over the past few years but I was just looking around on Kaggle for some datasets to practice and found find this beautiful [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshtomar736/ipl-mens-cricket-matches-data-2008-2023) of all IPL matches from 2008 to 2023.

The file ["CricketDataQueries.sql"](https://github.com/BitCub/exploratoryA_SQL/blob/main/CricketDataQueries.sql) is a compilation of queries that explores the dataset.

## Exploratory Analysis on Customer Churn Data (February 2024)

I work in telecommunications in a customer service capacity and experience first-hand disgruntled customers being fed up with their service providers and ultimately terminating their service. I always wondered (and still do) what the numbers were like for customers who churned and what the common denominator may be for customers who churned so this dataset gave me a chance to explore that.

The data was obtained from [IBM Accelerator Catalog](https://accelerator.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=authoring&pathRef=.public_folders%2FIBM%2BAccelerator%2BCatalog%2FContent%2FDAT00148&id=i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204&objRef=i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204&action=run&format=HTML&cmPropStr=%7B%22id%22%3A%22i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22reportView%22%2C%22defaultName%22%3A%22DAT00148%22%2C%22permissions%22%3A%5B%22execute%22%2C%22read%22%2C%22traverse%22%5D%7D) but I was lead there from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset/data) with the same data. The data is purely fictional. I used the “Telco_customer_churn.xlsx” file specifically in this case because of some inconsistencies that were discovered with one of the other files in the dataset.

The file ["CustomerChurn.sql"](https://github.com/BitCub/exploratoryA_SQL/blob/main/CustomerChurn.sql) is a compilation of queries that explores the dataset.
